## What is this?

[99 Bottles of OOP](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/) is a book by [@skmetz](https://github.com/skmetz) and [@kytrinyx](https://github.com/kytrinyx). It aims to be "a practical guide to writing cost-effective, maintainable, and pleasing object-oriented code." 

The examples in the book are all in Ruby. I love Ruby but I'm currently focussing my learning efforts elsewhere, namely in C# and .NET. So this repo is my attempt at working through the book using Microsoft's fine tooling. 

## How?

The book takes a Test Driven Development approach. This doesn't mean we write tests to go with the code. Oh no. This is proper TDD where we write the tests _first_, then write the code so that it passes the tests. 🏋🏻

To do the testing I'm learning the [xUnit.net](https://xunit.github.io/) unit testing tool.

Other tooling includes:

- Visual Studio 2017
- JetBrains ReSharper
